# About `solid-spectre`

The objective is to build UI elements for [solid.js](https://github.com/ryansolid/solid) using the beautiful [spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html). The plan is to have typescript definitions for all the elments. I haven't used any of these three technologies before so my purpose is partly to learn and partly to have something useful to quickly bootstrap MVPs.

The project is very much a WIP and I don't know whether I will finish it but I welcome PRs and issues.
